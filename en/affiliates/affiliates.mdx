## What is an affiliate?

Affiliates are experienced professionals who can provide personalized guidance and support for your needs. By connecting with an affiliate, you'll get access to their expertise and dedicated assistance.

Benefits of working with a verified affiliate
- Access to exclusive resources and training
- Ongoing professional assistance throughout your journey
- Priority support and faster response times
- Personalized guidance from industry experts

## How does the affiliate program work? 

There are two ways the affiliate program works:

1. **Invite an Affiliate to Your Account**: You can invite an affiliate to your account so they can help you manage your account, or you can be linked as a user to an affiliate who is already part of our affiliate program. This allows you to benefit from their expertise and support.

2. **Become an Affiliate**: You can apply to become an affiliate yourself at [this link](https://doko-ai.com/en/affiliate/platform/become-an-affiliate). Once you complete the application, you must register with Stripe Connect, which will verify your account so you can receive your client bonuses.

### Affiliate Bonus
As an affiliate, you can host unlimited accounts and receive a 10% monthly bonus in perpetuity as long as your clients/users maintain an active membership.

## How to access affiliates

You can access and manage affiliates from the settings tab (/settings) in your account.
